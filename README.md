# Establishing Norms:

## Each group should discuss and provide an answer for the following questions

### What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?

- _Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?_
  - Get the whole group involved and talk through the disagreement.

### What does this group do when a member is frustrated?

- _What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go._
  - Take a walk, take a break. If a person isnâ€™t meeting their deadline, then during the standup we can discuss it. If a person is struggling, then they should ask for help otherwise it will seem like they are not pulling their weight to meet the deadlines.

### What does this group do when we merge our work together?

- _Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else?_
  - The person will message in the group chat for approve and it will requires 2 members to approve the pull and merge.

### When does this group ask for help?

- _After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?_
  - 20 minutes

### How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?

- _Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?_
  - Refer back to these norms. Ask someone to pair with you if you need help.

### How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?

- _Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?_
  - It is up to that member if they choose to work after hours and/or weekend. However, they should be mindful of other memberâ€™s time and only contact them at a reasonable time (ex: donâ€™t contact after 10pm)
    - Jordy - Not available during bedtime hours
    - Sonia - Not available on Sunday (9/25)

### What time does this group have daily stand up?

- 10:45AM
